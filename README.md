# Cantilever Beam examples
Using SOFA, Simulation Open Framework Architecture, a cantilever beam fixed free configuration simulation was performed with a mass at its free end. Likewise, perform a simulation with one leg attached to the free end of the cantilever beam.

#### Cantilever beam with a mass at its free end.
Example_1_Beam.scn simulates a cantilever beam with a mass at its free end, as can be seen in the image.

#### Cantilever beam with the Hip and the Knee masses, with Femur between them, at its free end.
Example_2_Beam.scn simulates a cantilever beam with the Hip and the Knee masses, and with Femur between them, at its free end.

#### Cantilever beam with a Hip and Knee mass with foot, with Fumer and Tibia between them.
Example_3_Beam.scn simulates a cantilever beam with a hip mass, femur, knee mass, tibia and foot, at its free end.
Likewise, this simulation has a floor with which the foot touch the floor allowing the movement.

#### Linear movement of the Trunk, cantiliever beam, with attached leg at its free end
Example_4_Beam.scn simulates a cantilever beam, as a cheetah trunk, with a hip mass, femur, knee mass, tibia and foot, at its free end.
Likewise, this simulation has a floor with which the foot, touch the floor allowing the movement like walk, trot or gallop

# Legged Robot
Example_5_Beam.scn simulates a Planar Legged Robot.
This simulation allowins the movement like walk, trot or gallop.
